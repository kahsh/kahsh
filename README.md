### WHAT IS KAHSH

Kahsh is a cryptocurrency or “alt coin”. It’s pronounced “kaSH”. It is name play after the words cash and hash.

It is packed with rewards providing secure, anonymous, inexpensive payment solutions, allowing consumers and businesses to transact globally with ease and peace of mind. Kahsh will bring to the market cutting edge technology in which consumers and businesses can interact, save money and spend cryptocurrency. As part of the next generation of blockchain cryptocurrencies It focuses on providing businesses and consumers with the freedom to securely send or receive funds anywhere in the world without limitations and complete privacy.

#### KEY FEATURES

Kahsh combines next generation Masternodes with Proof of Stake technology to provide new services while rewarding those who support the network. 

Masternodes plays a very important role within the Kahsh blockchain ecosystem. They perform many functions associated with the well-being and efficiency of the network, such as governance, securely storing user data, processing transactions and promoting instant and private transactions.

We use an innovative technology called Proof of Stake which not only helps us save the environment from wasteful traditional mining hardware and absurd energy waste but instead, the users own wallet software helps maintain the network. They, in turn, receive rewards directly to their wallets. PoS rewards can be used in any way you like, including it can be saved up to create masternodes once you have the full collateral necessary. Think of it as you are your own bank and you receive daily interest to keep your money securely with you while helping maintain the network.
