<p><strong>Kahsh</strong> is an exciting new project designed to shape how augmented reality data is delivered.  By abandoning monolithic silo applications in favor of <em>widgetized</em> content, the <strong>Kahsh Display Manager</strong> will allow multiple content providers to share the Augmented Reality screen space by providing micro-services to create a unique and customizable user experience.</p>
<p><strong>The Kahsh Economic Platform</strong> will then provide an accounting mechanism to support pay-per-use and subscription models to compensate providers for their content and services.<p>
<p><strong>Kahsh Coin</strong> (XDH) is the foundation of the Kahsh Ecosystem.  Managed by a highly experienced and active team with years of blockchain experience, XDH uses established proof of stake 3.0 consensus algorithms with masternodes to secure the network.  The XDH project team plans to develop and deploy a <strong>next generation</strong> masternode network that will include long living masternode quorums within the year.  These features will make up the Kahsh <strong>proof of service</strong> system; enabling masternode network nodes to become true workhorses for delivery of advanced features to network users.</p>
